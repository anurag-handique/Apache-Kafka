# Kafka Location Update Service

## Overview
This project is a Maven-based Spring Boot application designed to manage location updates using Apache Kafka. It offers a scalable solution for processing a large volume of location data asynchronously.

## Features
- **RESTful API**: Provides an API endpoint to trigger location updates.
- **Kafka Consumer**: Listens to a specified Kafka topic for incoming location update messages.
- **Asynchronous Processing**: Utilizes multithreading and parallel execution for efficient processing.
- **Error Handling**: Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms to ensure message delivery.
- **Modular Design**: Organized into separate modules for better maintainability and extensibility.

## Technology Stack
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building robust and scalable applications.
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed streaming platform for handling real-time data feeds.
- **Java ExecutorService**: Java concurrency framework for managing thread pools.
- **Spring Kafka**: Integration library for Kafka with Spring applications.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool for managing dependencies and building the project.

## Usage
1. **Clone Repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kafka-location-update-service.git
   ```
2. **Build Project**:
   ```
   cd kafka-location-update-service
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Run Application**:
   ```
   java -jar target/kafka-location-update-service.jar
   ```
4. **Trigger Location Updates**:
   Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/location/update` to initiate location updates.

## Configuration
- **Kafka Settings**: Configure Kafka bootstrap servers and topic details in `application.properties`.
- **Concurrency**: Adjust thread pool size and timeout duration in `LocationController` for parallel processing.
